            Mahendra Singh Dhoni (Wicket Keeper)
        </h1>
        <p class="nama">
            MS Dhoni added another feather to his cap in 2021 edition of the league as CSK won their fourth title. Ahead
            of the 2022 edition of the league, MS Dhoni was one of the four retained players by the franchise and he was
            retained for a sum of INR 12 crore. A batting powerhouse, MS Dhoni possesses the ability to destroy
            different bowling attacks on his own. The calmness and composure in his demeanor along with a sharp
            cricketing brain accounts for a lethal combination on the cricketing field and the glistening silverware in
            the trophy cabinets at CSK are a testimony to his extraordinary leadership skills. He was the face of
            Chennai Super Kings for the first eight editions of the league, leading them to two titles (2010 & 2011) and
            four runner-up finishes. He then became the first player to be drafted by Rising Pune Supergiant in the
            ninth edition of the league. And, he once again became the first player to be retained by CSK ahead of the
            IPL Player Auction 2018. The 2018 season of the league had a fairytale ending with another glistening
            silverware added to the trophy cabinet of the Chennai Super Kings. The 2019 edition of the league too saw
            the CSK reach the finals of the tournament under MS Dhoni’s leadership. While MS Dhoni has hung up his boots
            on a 16-year illustrious career for Team India, he was seen donning the CSK colours once again in 2020.

        <p class="nama">
            16 matches, 635 runs and high score of 101* in the 2021 edition of the league, Ruturaj Gaikwad was retained
            by the CSK ahead of the 2022 edition of the league for INR 6 crore. The opening batter who hails from Pune,
            Ruturaj Gaikwad has been a consistent performer for his state team Maharashtra. He was the highest
            run-getter for Maharashtra in the league stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2018-19. At the IPL 2019
            Player Auction, the Chennai Super Kings secured his services at his base price of INR 20 lacs. He has been
            their most consistent opener and will look to do the same come April and May.
            On 2 October 2021, Gaikwad scored his first IPL century, with 101 not out against the Rajasthan Royals in
            the 2021 tournament.[53] On 15 October, Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 27 runs in the
            finals with Gaikwad contributing to CSK's total by scoring 32 runs off 27 balls. He won the Orange Cap for
            scoring the most runs (635) in the 2021 tournament and was also awarded the Emerging Player of the Year
            award.[54]

            Ravindra jadeja (All Rounder )
        </h1>
        <p class="nama">
            Jadeja’s love affair with runs and wickets continued at IPL 2021 and he was the highest paid retention for
            CSK ahead of the 2022 edition of the league. The outstanding all-rounder was retained for INR 16 crore.
            Earlier, he became the third retained player by CSK ahead of the IPL 2018 Player Auction. Ravindra Jadeja
            has always been MS Dhoni’s go-to-man when he needed to break a partnership and the left-armer has delivered
            the goods on many occasions. His presence gives Dhoni the extra cushion of playing an additional batsman if
            needed. Jadeja has been an enigma right since his advent in international cricket. He was part of the
            victorious Indian U-19 cricket team that won the World Cup in Malaysia in 2008. His performance in IPL 2008
            helped Rajasthan Royals to title victory and earned him the nickname "Rockstar" by his captain Shane Warne.
            In 2012 IPL player auction, Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for approx. Rs. 9.8 Crore, making him
            the most expensive player of the year's auction. Jadeja has represented the Gujarat Lions for two seasons
            and was back with CSK for the eleventh edition of the league. He has been an integral part of them ever
            since.

            Ajinkya Rahane (BatsMan)
        </h1>
        <p class="nama">
            In 2012, Rahane came in limelight when he scored a magnificent century in IPL. The following years helped
            him join the international matches. His performance in the 2018 season worsened and his strike rate came
            into talk. He is no longer included in India's ODI and T20I squads for international matches because of this
            reason. IPL 2019 was important for Rahane as he played some useful innings for Rajasthan; he also smashed a
            century against Delhi Capitals in the 2019 season and became the highest run scorer for Rajasthan Royals in
            that season. In November 2019, Rahane was transferred from Rajasthan Royals to Delhi Capitals ahead of the
            2020 Indian Premier League. The franchise retained him for the IPL 2021 season.[85] However, Rahane was
            barely included in any match for the 2021 season after some bad innings in the 2020 season. In February
            2022, he was bought by the Kolkata Knight Riders in the auction for the 2022 Indian Premier League
            tournament.[86]

            He is bought by Chennai Super Kings to play in the IPL 2023 season for INR. 50 Lakh in the IPL auction held
            on 23 December 2022.[87] In the 2023 edition of IPL, Rahane proved to be an integral part of the title
            winning CSK team where he came to bat at no.3, scoring at an extraordinary strike rate of 175+ in all the
            games. His crucial knocks proved to be match winning for CSK in the finals. This was Rahane's first IPL
            title.

            Deepak Chahar (Bowler)
        </h1>
        <p class="nama">
            CSK boy, Deepak Chahar is back with CSK for the 2022 edition of the league. It turned out to be fierce
            bidding war for the swing bowler, with SRH and Delhi Capitals starting the bids for Deepak and later were
            joined by RR and CSK for the same. It was as if the CSK had decided to get their man back into the ranks and
            finally succeeded in the same with a price of INR 14 crore. The Agra-born medium pacer, Deepak Chahar was a
            part of the Rajasthan Royals squad in 2012, donned the RPS jersey for two seasons and was bought by the
            Chennai Super Kings in the eleventh edition of the league. Chahar has risen through the ranks and his
            ability to swing the new ball both ways with control is what makes him a lot more lethal at the top. Chahar
            also possesses the ability to hit handy runs lower down the order and his current exploits, a match winning
            knock against Sri Lanka and a 34 ball 54 against South Africa has been the talk of the town. Ahead of the
            2018 season, Deepak was picked by the Chennai Super Kings and medium-pacer had a breakthrough 2018 IPL
            season taking 10 wickets in 12 matches. He was then subsequently rewarded with an India call-up in
            limited-overs cricket.A bowler in the mould of Praveen Kumar and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Chahar learned swing
            bowling at his father's coaching academy. Dhoni used him shrewdly with the new ball, often bowling him for
            three overs in the powerplay. Chahar also kept working on his other skills and turned himself into a capable
            bowler at the death, which was evident in that record-breaking spell against Bangladesh: four of his six
            wickets, including a hat-trick, came with a wet old ball in dewy conditions.

            with two runs required for victory.[citation needed] In 2021 he was the leading wicket-taker for Chennai
            with 21 wickets during the season.[citation needed]

            In February 2022, he was bought by Delhi Capitals in the auction for the 2022 Indian Premier League
            tournament.[32] After playing in 14 matches during the season, in November 2022 he was traded to the Kolkata

In the Vinoo Mankad Trophy of 2023, he showcased his prowess by amassing 274 runs in 6 innings with an impressive strike rate of 148.10, the highest among batters who scored over 200 runs in the competition. Avanish recently made his List A debut for Hyderabad. Nonetheless, he is recognized as a player with immense potential. Having represented India in the U19 Asia Cup, he is now poised to take on the role of India's primary wicket-keeper at the U19 World Cup in South Africa, further solidifying his status as one to watch. Aravelly Avanish, a dynamic left-handed wicket-keeper batsman who typically occupies the middle-order position, captured attention recently with his remarkable performance during a game in the Quadrangular series. Despite India 'A' U19 struggling at 95/5 while chasing 376, Avanish displayed superhuman prowess by smashing 163 runs off only 93 deliveries, steering his team to victory. His extraordinary innings included a stunning display of power hitting, as he launched 12 sixes. With this performance, it was just a formality that any team would pick him up in the Indian T20 league. The Chennai management swiftly acquired him as soon as his name popped in the 2024 auction. His commitment and consistency will be a key factor for his bright future.
